Join Our Mission as a Web Developer for TailsAdoption.org!

Tails Adoption is a brand new nonprofit project with the goal of ensuring every pet has a seamless transition from one caring owner to another. Our goal is to reduce the cost and stress of the entire adoption process of your beloved pets, both from the logistics of rehoming to the process of adoption. This is done by enabling the community to do so immediately online.

Volunteer Role Description

As a brand new project, our platform requires outreach. This involves informing clinics, shelters, sanctuaries, and various other pet-related facilities of our free services. There are several primary tasks that we need accomplished:

Coordinate outreach to facilities via phone call and Email follow-up.
Design infographics, PowerPoint presentations, brochures, and any other resources that illustrate an understanding of our service.
Share materials and coordination with other outreach coordinators via our Trello board and Google Chat.

Since we are just getting the ball rolling, all volunteers have the freedom to pitch their own projects for outreach and growth of our business. This also opens up the opportunity to spearhead and lead in your own role as a director.

Benefits of Your Role

Networking Opportunities: Connect with professionals in animal welfare fields.
Personal Development: Experience the satisfaction of making a tangible difference in pet welfare.
Merit: Build amazing accomplishments and experience for your future roles wherever you go.
