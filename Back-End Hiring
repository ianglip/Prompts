Sorry for the delayâ€”Iâ€™ve been swamped with my senior year, but itâ€™s wrapping up now! The site is running well with its core functions, though a few tweaks are needed. As a reminder, this is a remote-work, minimum-workload role, which mostly involves guidance with occasional front-end adjustments. Some areas I could use help with include:

1. Moving files to a dedicated Git for better collaboration.
2. Implementing sponsorships to fund and promote the site.
3. Adding user profile pages for managing posts (Google People API handles logins and submission data for Rehome).

The codebase is minimalist, so with your expertise, I think we can tackle it all in about an hour. If you're on board, feel free to showcase this opportunity as a credential for your role as a lead web developer at Tails Adoption ðŸ˜‰ I'm flexible with any roles claimed since we're brand new in this launch. We can also schedule for a live chat or call any time this week.
